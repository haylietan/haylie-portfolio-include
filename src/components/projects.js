                    Hi there! My name is Haylie.
                    I'm a current first-year student at UC Davis majoring in mathematics and scientific computation. Eager to bridge the gap between theory and practice, I'm exploring how mathematical rigor aligns with the creativity and innovation of the tech world. Beyond my academic pursuits, I am always looking to apply my skills, knowledge, and passion towards new and exciting projects.
                    Let's connect!
